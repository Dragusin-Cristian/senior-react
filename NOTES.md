# NOTES FOR EACH SECTION

## Controlled / Uncontrolled Components Pattern

- controlled components have their state managed outside and passed through props
- uncontrolled components have their state managed internally, and for primitive components the state can be accessed via refs

- Most known example is the controlled forms and uncontrolled forms

- More sophisticated example is the controlled and uncontrolled onboarding flow

- The preferred approach is using controlled components, because of managing state in a centralized way
